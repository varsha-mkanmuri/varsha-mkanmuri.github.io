Hello! I am Varsha, a Software Engineer at GE Healthcare and a recent MS in Computer Science graduate from Columbia University, specializing in machine learning.

Throughout my software engineering career, I have focused on backend application development, integrating my expertise in machine learning. For example, I optimized Elasticsearch infrastructure, reducing usage by 12%, and enhanced database capabilities by processing data from multiple real estate sources, expanding our client base by over 30%. I have had the privilege of working in both startup environments and large corporations, which has enriched my product sense alongside technical skills.

My passion lies in leveraging technology to create impactful solutions. With a strong background in software engineering and machine learning, I have gained valuable insights during my time at Columbia University, learning from exceptional mentors and sharing my knowledge through mentoring and teaching experiences. Graduating from Columbia University with a GPA of 4.03/4 and holding a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science, I have undertaken numerous projects and internships that demonstrate my dedication to software engineering and machine learning.

I am eager to bring my skills and enthusiasm to a team where I can continue to learn, tackle new challenges, and contribute meaningfully.
