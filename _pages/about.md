Hi! I am Varsha, a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Columbia University and an Ex-Senior Software Development Engineer.

I aspire to create meaningful solutions through technology. My focus is on software engineering and machine learning, the domains where I have extensive experience and interest. Before pursuing Masters at Columbia University, I worked as a senior software development engineer at Khoros and Radius Agent, developing scalable products for various clients, performing data analysis, system design, and algorithm optimization.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science, where I secured a first class with distinction. I completed several projects and internships that demonstrate my skills and passion for software engineering and machine learning. To name a few, I engineered scripts to reduce the infrastructure used by Elasticsearch by 12%, and I consolidated and processed property data from over 20 real estate search engines, increasing the internal database of potential clients by over 30%. 

I am eager to join an organization where I can continue to learn, be challenged, and make a real impact.
