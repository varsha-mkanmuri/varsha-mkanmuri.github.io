Hi! I am Varsha, a Master of Science in Computer Science student at Columbia University and an Ex-Senior Software Development Engineer.

I aspire to create meaningful solutions through technology. My focus is on software development engineering and machine learning, the domains where I have extensive experience and interest. I have worked as a senior software engineer at Khoros and Radius Agent, developing and improving scalable products and features for various clients and users. I have also used Python, SQL, and other programming languages and tools to perform data analysis, system design, and algorithm optimization.

I have a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University, where I graduated with a First Class with Distinction. I have also completed several projects and internships that demonstrate my skills and passion for software engineering and machine learning. For example, I engineered scripts to reduce the infrastructure used by Elasticsearch by 12%, and I consolidated and processed property data from over 20 real estate search engines, increasing the internal database of potential clients by over 30%. I am eager to join an organization where I can continue to learn, be challenged, and make a real impact.
